      <p class="description text-gr">All equipment removed by Patriot IT Solutions is logged with the corresponding make, model and serial numbers for your records and the equipment is sealed before departure in one of our GPS monitored vehicles, ensuring that every piece of equipment is safe and secure from outside tampering.</p>

    <p class="description text-gr">Once the equipment arrives at our secure facility, you will be able to monitor and keep track of any assets through our secure client portal. Our custom reporting and tracking system allows you to monitor your assets from pick-up to completion, ensuring full accountability.</p>
